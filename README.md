# UCL-East-Open-Day-Demos

A collection of basic demos of AI models running on streams of data.

## Demos

1. **BirdNET-spec**: A live spectrogram showing real-time predictions from the BirdNET model. Can be found on the `birdnet` folder, follow usage and installation instructions in the `README.md` file.
2. **MobileNet-camera**: A live webcam feed showing the detected objects by MobileNet SSD V3 in real time. Can be found on the `camera` folder, follow usage and installation instructions in the `README.md` file
3. **Batdetect2-spec**: A live spectrogram showing real-time detections from the BatDetect2 algorithm. Live recording is done at 22.5kHz and processed by the BatDetect2 algorithm at 256kHz by speeding up the resulting recording, hence low-pitched sounds will be interpreted as high-pitched sounds and might identified as bats.
